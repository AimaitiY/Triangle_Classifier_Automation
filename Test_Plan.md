Test Plan

Purpose:
The purpose of the test plan is to ensure the correct functionality, performance, reliability, security, and usability of the Triangle_Classifier application. The plan includes a comprehensive set of test cases to verify the application behaves as expected for various inputs.

Test Scope:
Conformance: Verify that the application correctly identifies valid triangles (Scalene, Isosceles, Equilateral) and handles errors correctly for invalid input.
Performance: Ensure that the application responds within acceptable time limits for a variety of inputs.
Reliability: Confirm that the application consistently produces correct results and doesn't crash unexpectedly.
Security: Ensure that the application handles invalid or potentially malicious inputs securely.
Usability: Ensure that error messages and outputs are clear and user-friendly.

Test Execution Criteria:
The application must handle all valid and invalid inputs as per the requirements.
All critical paths must pass before delivery.
The application must handle errors gracefully and securely.

Test Plan Completion Criteria
Pass/Fail: The application must pass all critical conformance, error handling, and performance tests.
Criteria for Delivery:
All conformance tests (valid triangle classifications) must pass.
All error-handling tests must return the correct error messages.
Performance must be within acceptable limits (response time < X seconds).
The application must not crash or expose security vulnerabilities during invalid inputs.
Error messages must be clear and user-friendly.
